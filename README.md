# OpenAI-and-ChatGPT-Exploration
This repository explores OpenAI for creating and subsequently troubleshooting 

  We have all seen the advent of Ai technology proliferate over the past five years. Every major tech company in the world now implements AI and machine-learning in their software, utilizing mass data to create learning plans for their AI. We are also seeing the proliferation of the same technology being used for entertainment on social media, with applications like DALI and Lensa becoming incredibly popular around the world. In the academic world, experts are astounded by the ability of ChatGPT to write decipherable-and even elegant-prose when given sufficient information (https://www.businessinsider.com/professors-say-chatgpt-wont-kill-college-essays-make-education-fairer-2022-12).
  
  OpenAI is quickly becoming one of the most utilized of these machine-learning algorithms, with DALI and ChatGPT both utilizing their software under the hood. In the last few weeks I have been experimenting with the capabilities of the software in writing and troubleshooting python code. I have found that the OpenAI playground does an incredible job of receiving and interpreting basic text commands and either converting them into code blocks or troubleshooting loaded blocks of text. As someone without a strong coding background, I can already see the benefits of this technology and have begun to reap the results.
